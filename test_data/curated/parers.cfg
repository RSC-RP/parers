> Are your sequencing primers in "reverse" orientation (Y/N)? Because P5 and P7 sequences can be placed on either side of the "mRNA" amplicon for Illumina sequencing, the order in which sequencing occurs is up to the investigator to choose. 
> "Reverse" orientation here refers to Read1 sequencing from the 3' end of the mRNA towards 5' end, and Read2 sequencing from 5' end of mRNA towards the 3' end. If the Read1 sequencing starts at 5' end of mRNA towards the 3' end, then enter "N".
